            <p class="bold life" id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Andrea Palladio's life and work:</p>
            <ul class="time">
              <li><span class="bold">1508</span> - Palladio was born in Padua, Italy.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1524</span> - He leaves Padua to permanently move to Vicenza where he became an assistant to a prominent stonecutter and stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. </li>
              <li><span class="bold">1538-1539</span> - He was employed by the humanist poet and scholar Gian Giorgio Trissino to rebuild his residence, the Villa Trissino at Cricoli.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1540</span> - Palladio received the formal title of architect, after which he made numerous trips to Rome, Tivoli, Palestrina and Albano to see the classical monuments first-hand and study the ancient Roman architecture.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1546</span> - Palladio starts working on the palace of the city government was called "Basilica" because of its functions and form of a modern city hall resembled those of an ancient Roman Basilica. He did not construct the building from the ground up, but added two-story loggias to the exterior of an older building. For the facade, Palladio made use of two levels of arcades with rounded arches and columns, which opened the exterior of the building to the interior courtyard. The arcades were divided by columns and small circular windows (oculi), with a variety and richness of decorative detail. The building was not completed until after Palladio's death.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1550</span> - Palazzo Chiericati was another urban palace, built on a city square near the port in Vicenza. It was constructed after the Palazzo della Ragione, but it was very different in its plan and decoration. The two-story facade with a double loggia was divided into eleven spaces by rows of Doric columns, while a Doric cornice separated the lower level from the more important piano nobile above.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1554</span> - He published the first of a series of books, The Four Books of Architecture, that were reprinted in different languages and circulated widely in Europe, securing his reputation as the most influential figure in the renewal of classical architecture.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1566</span> - He begun working on his most famous suburban villa, the Villa Capra "La Rotonda" for Count Paolo Almerico, the canon of Pope Pius IV and Pope Pius V. The site is on a gentle wooded hilltop, with views of the countryside in all directions. The villa is perfectly symmetrical, with four identical facades with porticos around the domed centre. The height of the base is exactly the height of the attic, and the width of each portico exactly half the length of the facade.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1570</span> - He was formally named "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after developing his own style of religious architecture maintaining original rigorous and perfectly balanced interior. Two of his most famous work are Santa Maria della Carit√† and San Giorgio Monastery.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">1580</span> - The final work of Palladio was the Teatro Olimpico in the Piazza Matteotti in Vicenza, built for the theatrical productions of the Olympic Society of Vicenza, of which Palladio was a member. The back wall of the stage was in the form of an enormous triumphal arch divided into three levels, and three portals through which actors could appear and disappear. This wall was lavishly decorated with columns and niches filled with statuary. The view through the arches gave the illusion of looking down classical streets. The painted ceiling was designed to give the illusion of sitting under an open sky. Behind the hemicycle of seats Palladio placed a row of Corinthian columns.<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - Palladio dies the same year at the age of 71.</li>
